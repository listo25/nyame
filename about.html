   <h1> About html</h1>
    <p></p>
HTML is a language use to create and design web site, i was introduced to this through WEB PROGRAMMING in 
level 200  in my educational journey. Dealing with html is really interesting,  i am realy happy of being 
into this as learning to become a web developer, to put carrier on hold, you need to work hard. Thouhg it not 
easy but i have been able to work on little aspect of it, through freecodcamp.

<h2>About html</h2>

<p>
    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for web pages.
It structures content using elements, attributes, and semantic tags.
HTML elements include headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists, tables, and forms.
Semantic elements like header, nav, main, section, and footer provide meaning.
HTML5 introduced multimedia support, canvas, SVG, and offline storage.
HTML is the backbone of web development, working with CSS and JavaScript.
